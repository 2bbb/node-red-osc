node-red-osc
============

The *node-red-osc* module adds support to Node-RED for sending and receiving OSC (Open Sound Control) messages to other systems.

This then makes it easy to bridge between other protocols, for example HTTP or MQTT.

Installation
------------

Change to your node-red installation directory and then run:

    npm install node-red-osc
    
You will then be able to see the two new OSC node types added to Node-RED's pallet on the left.
